# Java-Isolated-JDBC-Driver-Code
This repository offers two examples of code for a JDBC Driver in Java

This code demonstrates how to use a JDBC driver to connect to a MySQL database and execute a simple query to retrieve data from the customers table. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

The code starts by importing the java.sql package, which contains the JDBC API.

The main method loads the JDBC driver using the Class.forName method.

The code sets up the connection parameters including the URL of the database, the username, and password.

The code creates a Connection object using the DriverManager.getConnection method.

The code creates a Statement object using the Connection.createStatement method.

The code executes a query to retrieve all the records from the customers table using the Statement.executeQuery method.

The code processes the results of the query using a ResultSet object and a while loop.

Finally, the code closes all the resources including the ResultSet, Statement, and Connection objects.

This code snippet is just a basic example of using a JDBC driver to connect to a database and execute a query. In a real-world application, you would typically have more complex queries, error handling, and possibly use frameworks such as Spring JDBC to simplify the
